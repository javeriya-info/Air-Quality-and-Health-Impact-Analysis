# Air-Quality-and-Health-Impact-Analysis
Air Quality and Health Impact Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes the correlation between air quality and its impact on public health. Using data on air pollution levels and health outcomes, the project aims to identify trends, risks, and areas for improvement in public health policy related to environmental factors.

Features
Data Analysis: Comprehensive examination of air quality data and associated health metrics.
Visualizations: Interactive charts and graphs illustrating the impact of pollution on health outcomes.
Insights: Key findings highlighting the relationship between air quality and human well-being.
Tools & Technologies
Python: Primary language for data analysis and visualization.
Pandas: For data manipulation and cleaning.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: Libraries used for creating visualizations.
Jupyter Notebook: For organizing and presenting the analysis in an interactive environment.
How to Use
